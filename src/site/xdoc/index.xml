        <section name="Welcome to Hibernate Spatial">
            <p>Hibernate Spatial is a generic extension to Hibernate for handling geographic data. Hibernate Spatial is
                open source and licensed, like Hibernate, under the LGPL license.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hibernate Spatial allows you to deal with geographic data in a standardized way. It abstracts away from
                the specific way your database supports geographic data, and provides
                a standardized, cross-database interface to geographic data storage and query functions.
            </p>
            <p>Hibernate Spatial supports most of the functions of the OGC Simple Feature Specification. Supported
                databases are: Oracle 10g/11g, Postgresql/Postgis, Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL.
            </p>
            <p>There is a similar project for NHibernate:<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NHibernateSpatial">
                NHibernate.Spatial</a>.
