		<section name="Using Hibernate Spatial">
		<p>Hibernate Spatial is a generic extension to Hibernate for handling geographic data.
		It is generic in the sense that it works in the same way across different databases.
      </p>
      <p>
      Hibernate Spatial allows you to deal with geographic data in a standardized way, whatever 
      database that you use (as long as a Spatial Dialect Provider exists for it). In other words,
      it abstracts away from the specific way your database supports geographic data, and provides 
      a  standardized, cross-database interface to geographic data storage and query functions. 
      </p>
      <p>Hibernate Spatial supports most of the functions of the OGC Simple Feature Specification.
