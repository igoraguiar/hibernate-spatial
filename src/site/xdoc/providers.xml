        <section name="Spatial Dialect Providers">
            <p>
                Hibernate Spatial requires Spatial Dialect Providers to supply the database specific support for
                geographic data.
                Currently providers exist for Postgresql (PostGis spatial Extension), MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server (2008)
                and for Oracle 10g (Standard Locator).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you use only one database in you application, you just need to put the appropriate spatial dialect
                provider
                in your classpath. The Hibernate Spatial Extension will pick it up, and since it is the only provider in
                the classpath, use
                the dialect it provides as the spatial dialect
            </p>
